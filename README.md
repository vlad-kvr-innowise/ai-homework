# AI Homework

I complete homework with Cursor premium claude-3.5-sonnet. 
It's a premium model with limited requests.

Also, I've completed expense calculator with:
- Cursor premium claude-3.5-sonnet
- Cursor premium gpt 4.0-o
- Junie (JetBrains)

Claude-3.5-sonnet did the best job. 
Junie did the job, but the code quality is worse than claude's. 
GPT 4.0-o did the worst.

Also, Junie didn't create any warnings in a project. Cursor created seven warnings.

>Considering that when the fast queries for premium models expire, the quality will be worse than Junie's, I would prefer to continue using Junie.
